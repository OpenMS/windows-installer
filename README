This directory contains all files necessary to create a windows installer from an MinGW/MSYS installation of OpenMS (System A)

additional required software:
- NSIS (NullSoft Installer System)
 

Quick guide:
- fully compile and test OpenMS using a Visual Studio Generator (create OpenMS TOPP UTILS- NOT MORE!!)
- create the documentation ("doc" (NOT! idoc) in OpenMS_build/doc)
- create the PDF´s (tutorial and TOPP Docu) - might not work on windows, so copy them on this machine manually.
- adapt settings in the header of OpenMS_installer.nsi to your needs
- compile OpenMS_installer.nsi using NSIS (this should create a file named OpenMS_setup.exe)
- distribute


Verify the installer:
- use a VM (System B)
- do NOT assume that sucessfully installing OpenMS_setup.exe on the system A means that the installer will work
  on a new system (B)! But you can at least check for major quirks.
- check if all files were created and start-menu entries are present and working
- to test the TOPP tools, run TOPPTest_Assembler.pl on System A within an MSYS console
  e.g.
  > perl TOPPTest_Assembler.pl  /d/uni/OpenMS_Win/my/OpenMS
  	
	Now, copy the folder /OpenMS/source/TEST/TOPP/ to System B and run TOPP_test.bat (which should have been created by the perl script).
	
	Check if the script runs through without pausing (which means that something needs your attention).
	If you´re picky, then check the whole output of the script. Sometimes a TOPP-tool might give a warning
	and still produce the correct result, thus the script will not remind you of that.
