Congratulations!  You have successfully installed the TOPP tools of OpenMS and
the OpenMS library.

"TOPP" is an acronym for "The OpenMS Proteomics Pipeline".  It consists of
several small applications that can be chained to create analysis pipelines
tailored for a specific problem.

Note that the Windows binary release is meant for end-users only, rather than
for developers who want to contribute algorithms.  Developers should download
the source code version (see http://www.open-ms.de for details).

======================
Read the documentation
======================
To get familiar with TOPP we recommend reading the documentation.  Look into
your Start-Menu (Start - Programs - OpenMS) and open the Documentation page.
On the right side you will see the TOPP section.  Read it after finishing with
this document! Ignore any technical details; these are meant for developers.
Especially you should read the "TOPP tutorial".

The TOPP tools can be called from a Windows command line, or from a graphical
application called "TOPPView", which comes with this software (see
Start-Menu).  See the documentation for a tutorial on how to use TOPPView.

The INIFileEditor allows you to edit .ini-Files, which are XML configuration
files that every TOPP tool can use to adjust its parameters.

========================
The Windows command line
========================
To get familiar with the Windows command line, we recommend reading one of
many tutorials available on the internet
(e.g. http://www.voidspace.org.uk/python/articles/command_line.shtml).  The
most useful command you will need are 'cd' (change into a directory) and 'dir'
(list the content of the current directory).  You can get further information
on those commands by typing "help cd" or "help dir".  Typing "help" alone will
give you all available commands.  You will find a link in the OpenMS start
menu group, which opens a Windows command line.  Once the command line is
open, you can type 'dir' to see the names of the TOPP tools, which reside in
the directory.  You can just call a TOPP tool without any further arguments -
it will print some useful information and give you hints on how to use the
TOPP tool.  Note that you can call the TOPP tools from any directory, i.e. you
do not have to be in "C:\program files\OpenMS\TOPP" to call the FeatureFinder
tool.

===============
A small example
===============
Imagine you have an LC/MS dataset located at
"d:\mydata\experimental\lcms_0815.mzData" and you want to apply the PeakPicker
to it.

You can either open the graphical TOPPView, load the dataset and apply the
PeakPicker to it, or you can use the command line.  However, you should always
use TOPPView of get familiar with your data and know how to tweak the ini-File
parameters for the TOPP tools.  Usually the default settings won´t give you
the best results.  If your data is large (>200MB), its probably best to first
extract a smaller representative region (using FileFilter.exe) and view that
in TOPPView.

Now, here is a typical workflow:
- open the "TOPPView command line" from the OpenMS start menu group.
- change into your data directory, i.e. type 
                        
    d:
    cd d:\mydata\experimental
                
- [optional] apply the FileFilter to extract a smaller region 
  (if TOPPView can´t handle the full sized data)
                
    FileInfo -in lcms_0815.mzData 
        
  This will print basic statistics about the experiment 
  (i.e. retention time range, m/z range etc).
  Apply the FileFilter now:
                
    FileFilter -in lcms_0815.mzData -out lcms_0815_cutout.mzData -mz 800:1200 -rt 500:1500
        
  This will create the file lcms_0815_cutout.mzData, which only contains m/z 
  range of 800 to 1200 Th and a limited RT range.  The values obviously should
  be chosen accoding to the output of the previous FileInfo call.
        
- open TOPPView, load the (small) dataset and get familiar with it.  Now, apply 
  the PeakPicker (see TOPPView tutorial) within TOPPView and save the parameter
  settings you used as an .ini-File named lcms_0815_PeakPicker.ini.

- Switch back to your command line and apply the PeakPicker to the whole dataset:
                
    PeakPicker -in lcms_0815.mzData -out lcms_0815_pp.mzData -ini lcms_0815_PeakPicker.ini
                
  This should give you the file lcms_0815_pp.mzData.  Done!
